2.1 - I see the hex values of the ascii of the text. I can also see the text on the right too.

2.2 - I see a lot of 0 hex values. The ascii representation of the binary file is just a bunch of gibberish.

2.3 - 
Text files (like .c or .h) are encoded in plain ASCII or UTF-8 — directly viewable and editable by humans.
Binary executables contain compiled instructions, symbol tables, headers, and other metadata — structured for the operating system and CPU, not humans.

2.4 - file(1) uses a magic number database (in /usr/share/misc/magic). It checks the first few bytes of a fileagainst known "magic numbers" (signatures)
that idnetify types. For instance, ELF (executable and linkable files) start with "0x7F 45 4C 46". Text files contain only readable characters with no special
byte patterns and shell scripts often start with #!.
